Detailed documentation is always available through PHPDoc in your editor, so you can access it anytime.

I believe that the best way to learn some code is to see it in action. That's why within this documentation, aside from detailed specification of each method you will find various examples of using it which will help in faster understanding it's purpose and applications.

To quickly get started check out the links below or look at the full list of available methods in the left panel.
